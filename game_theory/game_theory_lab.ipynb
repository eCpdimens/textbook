    "## Part 1: The Penalty Kick Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In soccer (football) a penalty kick is awarded agaist the team that commits a punishable foul inside their penalty area. The fouled team chooses one player that is allowed to take one free kick at the opposing team's goal while only the goalkeeper can defend. No other players may interfere, so the penalty kick can be seen as a one-shot game with two players. The kicker wants to kick the ball into the goal; the goalie wants to prevent this from happening. I.e. the two players' goals are diametrically opposed. Moreover, following a kick it typically takes the ball about 0.3 seconds to reach the goal, making it impossible for the goalkeeper to react to the kicker's action; both the kicker and the the goalkeeper must decide what to do without knowing the other player's action."

We want to maximize the smaller of these two variables. Notationally, we can say $\\max_{x,y} \\min\\{x,y\\}$. For example, if $(x,y)= (2,3)$ would have an objective value of 2.
