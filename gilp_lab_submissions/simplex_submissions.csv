However, if we look at the (4)th constraint through, the bound is not satisfied ($14 < 15$). Therefore, in order for this to also satisfy the bound, $x_1$ should be equal to 3 and $x_2$ should be equal to 3 as well. As a result, you get a maximum objective function value of 26.

Ex for a constraint x <= 20, the slack is zero if x=20.",$x_3$ and $x_5$ are not in the dictionary. They represent the slack for $2x_1 + 1x_2 \leq 20$ and $1x_1 + 0x_2 \leq 7$,"Their values are 0. Their values tell us that the feasible solution at (7,6) is tangent to two of the constraints.",At the corner points. The variables not in the dictionary represent the constraints with 0 slack.,"These constraints intersect at the point (6,6,2).",The constraints that form the corner points have no slack. The constraints are maximized.,A feasable solution correspond to nonnegative slack slack variables.,At each iteration we try to convert the variables with positive coefficients in the objective function to ones with negative coefficients until there are none with positive coefficients left.,"There is no difference in the path because there is only one variable with a positive coefficient, thus, largest coefficient = smallest coefficient.",,"5, 4","Sadly, I struggled to get the code to work for this segment"
