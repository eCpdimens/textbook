Hence, the optimal value of the integer LP relaxation must be at least the optimal value of the integer program. Since the optimal value of the integer LP relaxation is both at most and at least the optimal value of the integer program, they must be equal. For maximization problems, the same reasoning applies, as the LP relaxation can be shown to both be a lower and upper bound for the IP program.","Every feasible solution to the IP is also a feasible solution to the LP. If there are no feasible solutions to the LP, there cannot be any feasible solutions to the IP.","The integer program is a minimization problem, since the optimal value at each node is at least the optimal value of parent nodes.","No, the marked node is not fathomed, because the linear relaxation has an optimal value of $16.3$, which means that the optimal value must be at least $17$. Since we know a feasible solution to the integer program with an objective function value of $20$, we cannot rule out there is not an optimal solution to the integer program with a better optimal value at that node.

This is because it might be possible to include fractional amounts of items $w_i$ in the linear program, so by removing the items, feasible solution of the LP relaxation also change. If one of the feasible solution is the optimal solution to the LP relaxation, then the optimal value could potentially increase.","One heuristic would be to add the item with the next greatest value per unit weight that does not exceed the remaining weight of the knapsack. If there are multiple such items, then add the item with the smallest weight. If there is no such item that can be further added, then the algorithm is finished.","Item $1$ would be added first, since it has the greatest value per unit weight of $5$. The remaining weight is $8$, so the item with the next biggest value per unit weight is item $5$. Now the remainig weight is $1$, and since there are not items with weight $1$, we can stop here.

My optimal solution was 62. I explored 4 nodes.,41.25,"$$\begin{align*}\max \quad & 5x_1+ 8x_2\\\text{s.t.} \quad & x_1 + x_2 \leq 6 \\& 5x_1 + 9x_2 \leq 45 \\& x_1 \leq 2\\& x_1, x_2 \geq 0, \quad \text{integral}\end{align*}$$$$\begin{align*}\max \quad & 5x_1+ 8x_2\\\text{s.t.} \quad & x_1 + x_2 \leq 6 \\& 5x_1 + 9x_2 \leq 45 \\& x_1 \geq 3\\& x_1, x_2 \geq 0, \quad \text{integral}\end{align*}$$",![title](LPBounds.png),Any feasible solution where $2 < x_1 < 3$,Add constraints $x_2 \leq 3$ and $x_2 \geq 4$. The original LP relaxation will now be broken into 3 regions.,Obj = 34. We can fathom the search at this node because it is an integral solution.,2 nodes have not been explored.,There are 2 leaf nodes. Leaf nodes represent a section of the feasible region.,,"$x_1 \leq 2, x_2 \geq 4, x_1 \geq 2$. There are no feasible solutions because the two constraints on $x_1$ limit it to only be equal to 2. The feasible region along the line $x_1 = 2$ stops at $x_2 = 3$, which contradicts the constraint on $x_2$.",Yes.,"It corresponds to the node with the objective value = 12 and solution (1,2,2).",13 nodes were explored. The optimal solution is 13. If we knew the value of the optimal solution beforehand we would have explored a maximum of 3 nodes.
