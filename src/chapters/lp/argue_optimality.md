# Argument that Solution is Optimal

The method consists of rewriting the constraints using algebra. By rewriting
the equalities, the feasible region is not changed, and neither is the
objective function. So the new LP is exactly the same as the old LP, just
written differently. The final LP gives both an upper bound on the objective
value, and a feasible solution with the objective value equal to this bound -
this must be the optimal solution to this last LP, and because the LP is
equivalent to the LP we started with, it must also be an optimal solution to
that LP.
