    "**Objectives**\n",
    " - Introduce students to congressional redistricting and gerrymandering\n",
    " - Introduce students to a new integer programming formulation\n",
    " - Expose students to measures of compactness and the efficiency gap\n",
    " - Give students experience creating congressional districts for differet objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading:** This lab is based on real congressional redistricting research done by Wes Gurnee and David Shmoys. More information about this research can be found at [fairmandering.org](https://www.fairmandering.org). A more complete description of the algorithm can be found [here](https://www.fairmandering.org/algorithm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief description:** In this lab, we will consider a section of a new paper on congressional redistricting. After summarizing the problem of congressional redistricting, we will give a breif overview of the the paper leading up to the relevant section. Lastly, we will explore possible districts for the state of Georgia subject to various objectives.\n",
