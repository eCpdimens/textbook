ENGRI 1101 Labs
===============

**NOTE:** This git repo was created at the end of Summer 2020 after significant course development. All labs were replaced with a web-based or Jupyter Notebook equivalent. AMPL was replaced by Google's OR-Tools.

This git repo serves as the standard for the ENGRI 1101 labs. Any updates or additional labs should be added here. Furthermore, this README contains a comprehensive list of labs as well as necessary Python packages. They should be updated to relfect any changes made to the labs.
