    "You are a pizza delivery person for Good Pizza, Inc. Good Pizza is located on Cornell’s campus and guarantees delivery in 30 minutes or less anywhere in Tompkins County. In order to maximize the amount of your tips, you want to deliver as many pizzas as you can and deliver them as fast as you can. Therefore, you would like to know the quickest way of getting from the pizza shop to various parts of Tompkins County. Because of speed limits and various geographical obstacles (of which there are many in Tompkins County), it is not always best to take the route that covers the shortest distance. For instance, to get to Groton from the Northeast, it is quicker to go through Freeville than to try to go straight to Groton because Route 38 goes directly from Freeville to Groton and has a speed limit of 55 mph.\n",
