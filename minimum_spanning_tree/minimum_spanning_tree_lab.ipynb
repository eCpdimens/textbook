Since you can only use the edges shown in the graph, you must choose a subgraph of the given graph, or in other words, a subset of the possible edges. Every location must be serviced which means that the subgraph must be spanning. You should be able to get to any location from any other location. This means the subgraph should be connected. Because you are trying to minimize cost, the subgraph should also be minimal, meaning that you cannot remove any of the edges while maintaining the other necessary properties. A minimal connected spanning subgraph is called a spanning tree. There are many other ways of defining trees. In operations research terminology, we want to find a minimum spanning tree of the given graph."
