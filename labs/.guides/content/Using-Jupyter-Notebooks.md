<h2>The Structure of a Notebook</h2>
<div class="p-tag">Each body of text or code in a Jupyter notebook is called a cell. A cell has three
  types: 
  
<ul>
  <li>code</li>
  <li>markdown</li>
  <li>raw text</li>
</ul>
</div>
  
<div class="p-tag">
  To add a cell, simply select an existing cell (new notebooks are initialized with
  one), and press the <code>A</code> key to add a new cell above, or the <code>B</code> key to add a new cell
  below the selected cell. Alternatively, select <strong>Insert</strong> in the top menu, and choose
  "Insert Cell Below" or "Insert Cell Above."
</div>

<h2>Running Code</h2>
<div class="p-tag">
  To execute Python in a cell, the cell type must be set to code. Upon executing it
  (either by pressing shift-enter or selecting <strong>Run</strong> in the menu bar) the output of the
  code, if any, will appear below the cell containing the code. Code in subsequent
  cells share a kernel, which lets you organize and execute code in a piece-wise manner.
</div>

<h2>Reset Code</h2>
<div class="p-tag">
  To clear the output, in the menu bar click <strong>Kernel</strong> and select <strong>Restart & Clear Output</strong>. This
  not only clears all output from executed code, but also restarts the kernel, so any
  set variables or any other persistent action from previously executed code will be
  lost.
</div>

<h2>Submit Code</h2>
<div class="p-tag">Once you have completed your work on this notebook, you will submit your code for autograder/instructor review. Follow these steps:</div>

<ol>
  <li>In the blue menu bar along the top of this code exercise window, youâ€™ll see a menu item called <strong>Education</strong>. In the <strong>Education</strong> menu, click <strong>Mark as Completed</strong> to submit your code for autograder/instructor review. This process will take a moment and a progress bar will show you the status of your submission.</li>
	<li>Once your work is marked as complete, the results of the autograder will automatically be presented in a new tab within the code exercise window. You can click on the assessment name in this feedback window to see more details regarding specific feedback/errors in your code submission.</li>
  <li>The Jupyter notebook will always remain accessible in the first tabbed window of the exercise. To reattempt the work, you will first need to click <strong>Mark as Uncompleted</strong> in the <strong>Education</strong> menu and then proceed to make edits to the notebook. Once you are ready to resubmit, follow steps one through three. You can repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.</li>
</ol>
